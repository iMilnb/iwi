# An example article

## A subtitle

### Sub-sub title

Very interesting `example` of my lightweight _Wiki_ using the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) markup language.

It is rendered via `python` [Markdown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown) which supports
```
fenced_code():
	rendering = True
```

It is

* based on [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* Not bullet proof
* Not aimed at being an exposed service

It bundles _Twitter_'s [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) _CSS_es, feel free to use your own.

**iWi** only needs:

1. Flask
2. python Markdown

## Workflow

Change the `frontpath` variable in `iwi.py` to suit your needs. And begin writing!

Simply edit `main.md`, add a link to a `.md` file located in the `docs/` directory, that's it.

Enjoy *iWi*!
